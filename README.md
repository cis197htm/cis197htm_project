# cis197htm_project

Olga Kapora, CIS197HTM, Spring.

The purpose of this repo is to build a webpage template.

My technology stack would be JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

My topic would be Lasagna and it falls within the Food category.

My different pages would be Nutrition Facts, Recipe and About.

The information that I will include there would be the amount of calories, carbs, fat, fiber, protein, and vitamins per serving of the food, next is a recipe how to make the delicious lasagna, last but not least is, when the lasagna was made, by whom and where, also why is lasagna a special dish.
