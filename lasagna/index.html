        <p>Is there anyone who doesn't love lasagna? Its layered pasta sheets filled with a variety of meaty, cheesy goodness are a menu staple in Italian restaurants, and a comfort food favorite baked in home kitchens around the globe. 

        <p>Even further back, the word lasagna comes from the Greek word laganon and is known to be the closest thing to pasta that ancient Romans cooked.</p> 
        
        <p>As is the case for many dishes of Italian cuisine whose origins go back in time, lasagna was quite different centuries ago from how it is today, evolving and acquiring several variations before being codified in the classic version of Bolognese cuisine.</p>
            
        <p>In southern Italy lasagna is generally made with dried sheets of pasta layered with rich meat ragú, ricotta and mozzarella.</p>
            
        <p>The modern version of Lasagna was invented sometime between 1544 & 1692 – most likely in either Emilia Romagna or Naples (Napoli).</p>
